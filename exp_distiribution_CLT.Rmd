## Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to investigate the exponential distribution
and compare it to the Central Limit Theorem. For this analysis, the lambda will 
be set to 0.2 for all of the simulations. This investigation will compare the 
distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over 1000 simulations.


## Simulations
Set the simulation variables lambda, exponentials, and seed.
```{r}
ECHO=TRUE
set.seed(1337)
lambda = 0.2
exponentials = 40
```

Run Simulations with variables
```{r}
simMeans = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) simMeans = c(simMeans, mean(rexp(exponentials, lambda)))
```


## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
#### Sample Mean
Calculating the mean from the simulations with give the sample mean.
```{r}
mean(simMeans)
```
